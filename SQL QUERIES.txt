Here are the SQL queries which you need to run in the MySQL server
-> CREATE DATABASE INVOICES;
-> USE INVOICES;
-> CREATE TABLE extracted_invoices (
    ->     ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     Invoice VARCHAR(50)
    -> );
-> CREATE TABLE extracted_values (
    ->     ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     IRIN VARCHAR(24), -- Adjust length according to your needs
    ->     Ack_No VARCHAR(25) -- Adjust length according to your needs
    -> );
-> INSERT INTO extracted_values (IRIN, Ack_No) VALUES ('<IRIN_VALUE>',                           '<ACK_NO_VALUE>');
-> INSERT INTO extracted_invoices (Invoice) VALUES ('<INVOICE_VALUE>');
-> SELECT * FROM extracted_values;
-> SELECT * FROM extracted_invoices;

----The extracted data will be seen in the table format---
